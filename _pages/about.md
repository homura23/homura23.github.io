I got my master degree at [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) and the [Lab. for Sound and People with Computing](https://lspc.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp).

Before the master program, I got my bachelor's degree at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/), majored in Computer Science and Technology(Japanese Intensive). At that time, I becomed interested in music and started to imagine creating music by Artificial Intelligence.

My research topics are about Lyrics/Music Generation&Understanding, Multi-modality Data Alignment, Multilingual Research. Including technologies such as LLM, computer music, AI/ML, signal processing.
My dream is to **explore the intrinsic consistency of music, human languages, and mathematics**. I'd like to fuse the inspiration by human with the "learning" by computer to creative fantasic AI music. 


Research Projects
======
**Lyrics Generation**
Title: <<Modeling the Structural and Semantic Features for Japanese Lyrics Generation of J-pop Songs>>  
Abstract: we propose a Japanese lyrics generation model named Okashi that can generate lyrics with clear structure, high text quality, and conformity to human lyrics writing principles. 
More detail: (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-0119-6_31)

**Symbolic Music Generation**
Title: <<Chord Conditional Automatic Songwriting System with Phrase-Motif Level Alignment>>  
Abstract: This research aims to develop an automatic song generation system that takes chord progression as input to generate lyrics and melody that are aligned in terms of structure and musicality.  

&#127932;To sum up, computational musicology is an interesting but challenging interdisciplinary research field but have not been explored well. We need more effects!
My future research programs show as below:

* Lyrics Translation 
* Musical features analysis/Alignment
* Any-modality-to-Music Generation 
* To be continued...
