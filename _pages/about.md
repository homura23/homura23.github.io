I'm a master student at [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) and the [Lab. for Sound and People with Computing](https://lspc.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/en).
My research topics are about automatic songwriting, analyzing the lyrics-melody relationship, and lyrics/melody generation.

Before the master program, I got my bachelor's degree at [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/), majored in Computer Science and Technology(Japanese Intensive). At that time, I becomed interested in music and started to imagine creating music by Artificial Intelligence.

My dream is to **explore the intrinsic consistency of music notes, human languages, and mathematics**. I'd like to fuse the inspiration by human with the "rules" by computer to creative fantasic AI music. 

My research interests includes Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Music Information Retrievel, and their application on automatic composition. 

Research Projects
======
**Music Understanding and Music Generation of lyrics and melody**
I'm working on analyzing the lyrics-melody alignment and lyrics-to-melody generation at present. And I'd like to try melody-to-lyrics generation and multi-language lyrics translation in the future. 
&#127932;To sum up, computational musicology is an interesting but challenging interdisciplinary research field but have not been explored well. We need more effects!
My current research programs show as below:

* Modeling the Rhyming Words and Storyline for Lyrics Generation of J-pop Songs 
* Extracting Musical Features from Lyrics Text and Audio for Melody Generation 
* To be continued...
